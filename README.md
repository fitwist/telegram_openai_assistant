- You have a `Python` environment running version 3.7+.
- You have a Telegram account and have created a bot with `@BotFather` to obtain a token.
- You have an `OpenAI` account to obtain your API keys.

You also need 

- An open ai assistant id : https://platform.openai.com/assistants
- An open ai API key : https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- A telegram token : use botfather directly from telegram to create your bot and get the telegram token

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/efelem/telegram_openai_assistant
cd telegram_openai_assistant
```

## Configuration
